Prerequisites
=============

Cattle depends on the following libraries and programs:

  * the GLib library and its GObject module;

  * the `pkg-config` script;

  * optionally, GObject Introspection, if you want to give more languages
    access to Cattle;

  * optionally, the GTK-Doc tools, if you wish to rebuild the API reference
    yourself (a pre-built copy is shipped along with the sources).
