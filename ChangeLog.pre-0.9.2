2008-10-02  Andrea Bolognani  <eof@kiyuko.org>

	* === Released 0.9.2 ===

2008-10-01  Andrea Bolognani  <eof@kiyuko.org>

	* configure.in: Bumped version number.

2008-09-11  Andrea Bolognani  <eof@kiyuko.org>

	* cattle/cattle-tape.c (CattleTapePrivate): Splitted the limit field
	  into two separate fields, upper_limit and lower_limit.

	* cattle/cattle-tape.h (cattle_tape_pop_bookmark):
	* cattle/cattle-tape.c (cattle_tape_pop_bookmark): Return a boolean value.

2008-09-09  Andrea Bolognani  <eof@kiyuko.org>

	* tests/tape-limits-test.c: Simple test to make sure the limits (i.e.
	  beginning and end) reported by the tape are correct.

2008-09-08  Andrea Bolognani  <eof@kiyuko.org>

	* examples/interpreter.c (debug_handler): Added a custom handler for
	  the "debug-request" signal, and turned debug on.

	* cattle/cattle-tape.h:
	* cattle/cattle-tape.c: Removed the dump() method.

2008-09-07  Andrea Bolognani  <eof@kiyuko.org>

	* cattle/cattle-interpreter.c: Initial implementation of
	  the "debug-request" signal.

2008-09-01  Andrea Bolognani  <eof@kiyuko.org>

	* cattle/cattle-tape.c (CattleTapePrivate): Added a limit field, used to
	  store the offset of the last valid byte inside the last chunk.

	* cattle/cattle-tape.c (cattle_tape_is_at_end): Fixed to use the
	  newly-introduced limit field.

2008-08-30  Andrea Bolognani  <eof@kiyuko.org>

	* cattle/cattle-tape.c (cattle_tape_dump): Fixed to work with chunks; it
	  would actually need some other changes to work as expected, but I'm not
	  going to rework it further since the current implementation is going to
	  be obsoleted soon and it's currently only useful to debug the bookmarks
	  code. is_at_beginning() is affected by the same issue and as such
	  doesn't work reliably.

2008-08-28  Andrea Bolognani  <eof@kiyuko.org>

	* cattle/cattle-tape.h:
	* cattle/cattle-tape.c: Started implementing tape bookmarks.

2008-08-20  Andrea Bolognani  <eof@kiyuko.org>

	* cattle/cattle-instruction.h:
	* cattle/cattle-program.h:
	* cattle/cattle-tape.h:
	* cattle/cattle-configuration.h:
	* cattle/cattle-interpreter.h: Added a pointer to the instance's private
	  structure to the instance itself, to avoid calling the GET_PRIVATE()
	  macro for every method call. Huge speed boost.

2008-08-03  Andrea Bolognani  <eof@kiyuko.org>

	* === Released 0.9.1 ===

2008-08-01  Andrea Bolognani  <eof@kiyuko.org>

	* configure.in: Bumped version number.

	* README: Slightly updated.

	* cattle/cattle-tape.c (cattle_tape_dump): Updated and re-enabled.

2008-07-31  Andrea Bolognani  <eof@kiyuko.org>

	* examples/indent.c: Added reference handling.

	* examples/interpreter.c:
	* examples/indent.c: Added copyright notice.

2008-07-29  Andrea Bolognani  <eof@kiyuko.org>

	* docs/reference/io-handling.xml: New file, explaining in detail how
	  input and output are handled by Cattle.

2008-07-25  Andrea Bolognani  <eof@kiyuko.org>

	* examples/indent.c:
	* examples/Makefile.am: Added a new example.

2008-06-22  Andrea Bolognani  <eof@kiyuko.org>

	* Makefile.am:
	* gtk-doc.make:
	* cattle/Makefile.am: We don't want anything to be installed yet.

2008-06-16  Andrea Bolognani  <eof@kiyuko.org>

	* cattle/cattle-interpreter.c (run_real): Finished implementing the
	  input support. Added lots of comments.

2008-06-14  Andrea Bolognani  <eof@kiyuko.org>

	* cattle/cattle-interpreter.c (run_real): More work on the input support.
	  Normal input works fine now; end of input still needs to be handled
	  properly.

2008-05-25  Andrea Bolognani  <eof@kiyuko.org>

	* cattle/cattle-interpreter.h (CattleInterpreterClass):
	* cattle/cattle-interpreter.c (cattle_interpreter_class_init): Initial
	  implementation of the "input-request" signal.

	* cattle/cattle-interpreter.c (run_real): Don't ignore the quantity of
	  an instruction if its value is CATTLE_INSTRUCTION_READ.

2008-05-19  Andrea Bolognani  <eof@kiyuko.org>

	* cattle/cattle-program.c: The value of the "instructions" must be
	  non-NULL. An empty program can be represented by a single instruction
	  with value CATTLE_INSTRUCTION_NONE.

2008-05-18  Andrea Bolognani  <eof@kiyuko.org>

	* cattle/cattle-tape.h (CattleTapeClass):
	* cattle/cattle-tape.c: Removed the "position-changed" signal, since it
	  was of little use and the high number of emissions caused severe
	  performance loss.

	* cattle/cattle-instruction.c:
	* cattle/cattle-program.c:
	* cattle/cattle-configuration.c:
	* cattle/cattle-tape.c:
	* cattle/cattle-interpreter.c: Don't emit the "notify" signal on every
	  property change to improve performance.

2008-05-15  Andrea Bolognani  <eof@kiyuko.org>

	* cattle/cattle-program.h (CattleProgramError):
	* cattle/cattle-program.c: Renamed CATTLE_PROGRAM_ERROR_INVALID_UTF8
	  to CATTLE_PROGRAM_ERROR_BAD_UTF8, to be consistent with GLib.

2008-05-11  Andrea Bolognani  <eof@kiyuko.org>

	* cattle/cattle-program.h (CattleProgram):
	* cattle/cattle-configuration (CattleConfiguration):
	* cattle/cattle-tape (CattleTape):
	* cattle/cattle-interpreter (CattleInterpreter): Made all the instance
	  structures opaque. The structures are not declared in the .c file
	  to allow derived types.

2008-05-06  Andrea Bolognani  <eof@kiyuko.org>

	* cattle/cattle-instruction.h (CattleInstruction): Moved all the
	  instance members into the CattleInstructionPrivate structure declared
	  in the .c file. You were not supposed to access them directly anyway.

2008-05-04  Andrea Bolognani  <eof@kiyuko.org>

	* cattle/cattle-interpreter.h (CattleInterpreterClass):
	* cattle/cattle-interpreter.c (cattle_interpreter_class_init): Initial
	  implementation of the "output-request" signal.

	* cattle/cattle-interpreter.c (run_real): Emit the "output-request"
	  signal when needed instead of handling output directly.

	* cattle/cattle-marshal.list: New file, used to generate the marshallers
	  needed for signal emission.

2008-05-02  Andrea Bolognani  <eof@kiyuko.org>

	* cattle/cattle-tape.h (CattleTape):
	* cattle/cattle-tape.c: Re-implemented CattleTape using fixed-sized
	  chunks instead of allocating each memory cell separately. This
	  improves both performances and memory usage. Thanks to Thomas Thomas
	  for suggesting this approach.

	* configure.in: Moved from PKG_CHECK_MODULES to AM_PATH_GLIB_2_0, which
	  sets GLIB_MKENUMS automatically.

	* configure.in: Added AM_PROG_CC_C_O, which seems to be needed to
	  correctly compile examples/interpreter.c.

2008-04-16  Andrea Bolognani  <eof@kiyuko.org>

	* === Released 0.9.0 ===

2008-04-12  Andrea Bolognani  <eof@kiyuko.org>

	* cattle/cattle-instruction.c:
	* cattle/cattle-program.c:
	* cattle/cattle-tape.c:
	* cattle/cattle-configuration.c:
	* cattle/cattle-interpreter.c: Removed declaration of init(),
	  class_init(), dispose() and finalize() methods, as they are already
	  declared by G_DEFINE_TYPE().

2008-04-09  Andrea Bolognani  <eof@kiyuko.org>

	* cattle/cattle-interpreter.c (run_real): Use fputc() instead of
	  g_print() to perform output, gaining in speed.

2008-04-07  Andrea Bolognani  <eof@kiyuko.org>

	* README: Wrote some quick informations on what Cattle is and about its
	  current development status.

2008-03-28  Andrea Bolognani  <eof@kiyuko.org>

	* cattle/cattle-interpreter.h (cattle_interpreter_get_program):
	* cattle/cattle-interpreter.c (cattle_interpreter_get_program):
	  Modified to take and return a CattleProgram instead of a
	  CattleInstruction.

2008-02-28  Andrea Bolognani  <eof@kiyuko.org>

	* ChangeLog: Started ChangeLog.
