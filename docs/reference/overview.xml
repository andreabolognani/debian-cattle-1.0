	<title>Overview</title>

	<para>
		Cattle is a toolkit for the Brainfuck programming language.
	</para>

	<para>
		The library allows one to inspect a Brainfuck program in various
		ways, and to easily embed a full-featured Brainfuck interpreter
		into any application; to make the interaction between the hosting
		application and the Brainfuck interpreter completely transparent,
		Cattle can be configured to use a custom set of I/O routines
		instead of the default ones.
	</para>

	<para>
		The behaviour of the interpreter itself is highly configurable,
		as to fit most needs.
