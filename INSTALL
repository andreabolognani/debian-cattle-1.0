Prerequisites
=============

Cattle depends on the following libraries and programs:

  * The GLib library and its GObject module

  * The pkg-config script

  * Optionally, GObject Introspection, if you want to give more
    languages access to Cattle

  * Optionally, the GTK-Doc tools, if you wish to rebuild the API
    reference yourself (a pre-built copy is shipped along with the
    sources)
